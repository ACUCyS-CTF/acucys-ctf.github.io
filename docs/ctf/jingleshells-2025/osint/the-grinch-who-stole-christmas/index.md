**Hint**: I am the best CTF player there is. Nobody does CTFs better than me - believe me. I walk into a challenge, and the flags just surrender. Crypto? Solved. Web? Destroyed. Pwn? Total domination. People come up to me - top hackers, very smart people - and they say, "Sir, how do you do it?" And I tell them: incredible instincts, tremendous brain.
