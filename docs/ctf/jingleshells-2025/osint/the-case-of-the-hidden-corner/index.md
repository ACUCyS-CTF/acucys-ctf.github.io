**Challenge Description**: Detective, it’s the most wonderful time of the year - but your latest case arrives like an unwrapped Christmas surprise. Inside the envelope is a single photograph: no note, no return address, just a snowy corner waiting to be placed on the map. Rumor says it's from a small lakeside city once known for shipbuilding, where winters bite hard and summers smell of fried curds. The streets run straight as if drawn by Santa himself. Somewhere nearby, a familiar daily rhythm hums beneath the holiday calm. Your mission is simple: pinpoint the exact intersection where the photo was taken.

**Hint 1**: Morning bells are where you went before comes to university.

**Hint 2**: You may go to the place where you can hear quiet footsteps, if you do something wrong.
