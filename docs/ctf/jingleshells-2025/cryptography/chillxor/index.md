**Challenge Description**: While Santa's chilling by the beach, you come across a short string that looks like pure holiday gibberish. It turns out it's been base64-encoded after being XOR’d with a short English word - wrapped up like a sneaky Christmas gift

**Hint**:

Listen up, recruit. During a covert interception mission, our cyber-intel unit captured an encrypted transmission from an enemy communications relay. The message looks harmless - just a short string of gibberish - but command believes it hides a crucial access flag.

Our analysts discovered traces of Base64 encoding layered over an XOR cipher, encrypted with a short five-letter English word — one that means relax.

Your mission is simple: Decode the message, reveal the hidden flag, and report back to command.
