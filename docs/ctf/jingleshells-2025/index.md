# ACUCyS Jingle Shells CTF

Jingle Shells CTF is ACUCyS’ Christmas themed, student-led Capture The Flag competition for Australian university cyber students, run online. It is built by students, for students, with challenges and coordination led by university cyber clubs from across the national ACUCyS network.

The inaugural run took place from 20 December, 9am to 21 December, 9pm AEDT, and featured 40+ original challenges across categories including web, crypto, OSINT, reversing, Linux, and more. Promoted around university teams of four, it drew over 250 participants and was ACUCyS’ first major flagship event.

The competition was designed to:

- Unite university cyber clubs nationally around a shared, student-run event.
- Give students practical, team-based experience across a broad range of CTF categories.
- Showcase the capability of student organisers and contributors within the ACUCyS community.
- Build momentum for future ACUCyS initiatives, including further CTFs, hackathons, and conference activity.
