**Challenge Description**: While Santa's soaking up the sun, our agents intercepted a postcard-worthy vacation photo from a mysterious figure known as Specter. At first glance it’s all beach vibes and holiday calm - nothing suspicious at all. But Specter never sends anything without leaving a trace. Somewhere beneath the warm pixels and festive glow, a quiet message waits to be discovered. Look closely… this seaside snapshot may be hiding more than memories.
