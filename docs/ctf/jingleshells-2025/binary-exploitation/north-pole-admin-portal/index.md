**Challenge Description**: Santa’s elves have made a new machine to package presents for them. The grinch has gotten his hands on a prototype version and has already modified it to add his proprietary binary exploitation scanner, but he can’t find the flag. Maybe you can give it a shot?

**Hint 1**: It seems the elves have used some unsafe code… unsafely… you might want to check it out.

**Hint 2**: After typing away at GrinchGPT, it spat out a bunch of slop and the word "VTABLE," maybe that’s something useful?
