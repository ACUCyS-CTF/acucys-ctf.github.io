Challenge Description: One of the elves has a secret crush on Santa and slipped a love letter into the mail sack. To keep it hidden, she encrypted it by mapping letters to numbers, using the Unicode value of her favourite colour heart emoji. Can you figure out the Unicode and unlock her heartfelt message?

Hint: Look at the Unicode of U+1FA77, to unlock the message. The encryption involves mapping letters to numbers (A=0, B=1,…), so think about how that might work!
