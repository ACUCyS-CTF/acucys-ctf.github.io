Challenge Description: At 04:13, while Santa's enjoying a beach sunrise, a recon UAV caught a brief holiday directive from a forward post. Before it reached HQ, a frantic maintenance script scrambled it in three festive layers and archived the result. The artifact is short - just one `AUCTF{…}` order. Recover it fast… the relay buffer rots away like snow in the sun.

Hint: Enemy used a quick field-scramble: undo the recorder’s scrambling, unwrap the alphabet camouflage, decode the payload, then hunt the repeated bird-code with a short five-letter key - crib the standard flag header to confirm
