Challenge Description: Santa has been targeted by naughty kids trying to hack his secrets, so he has started storing them as hashes. However, the kids discovered Santa’s hashed password. Figure out what password Santa used by reversing the hash.

Hint: Santa’s favourite hashing library in Python is hashlib, but the kids didn’t even need Python to break it. Maybe they looked it up somewhere?
