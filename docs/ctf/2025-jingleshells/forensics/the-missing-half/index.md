Challenge Description: Santa's beachside hard drive has a mystery: a holiday secret split in two. One piece is easy to spot, basking in the sun, while the other has slipped beneath the waves and faded from view. Dig a little deeper, chase what was left behind, and reunite the fragments to uncover what this festive system tried to forget.

Hint: The file conceals a story told in pieces. One part can be found with ease, while the other lingers in places often overlooked. Discover what the system tries to forget and piece them together to reveal the full flag.
