**Challenge Description**: Santa's running the Reindeer Command Center from the beach, but the control panel might not be as locked down as it looks. Holiday shortcuts, festive scripts, and trusted badges all play a role in keeping things running. Somewhere in the summer heat, a small oversight could turn a regular elf into the one calling the shots.
