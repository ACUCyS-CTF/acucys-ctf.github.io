Challenge Description: Doctor Charlotte cracked the key to Enderland's ultimate vault and sent it off just before Christmas - we intercepted it on the shoreline. While Santa's enjoying the sun, her weakness remains the same: an ancient, unpleasant tongue, harsh to hear but clever by design. Somewhere beneath the festive glow and beach light, the language awaits. Let the light guide you on Y.

Hint 1: Look at the color count. The most frequent color is the increment command. Start there.

Hint 2: Not every pixel matters. The bright ones hold secrets, the dark ones are just background noise. Follow the colors in order, and the loops will guide you.
