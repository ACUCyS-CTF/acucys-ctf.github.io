**Challenge Description**: Santa's beach day is interrupted by Doggo the pitbull, happily digging in the sand with a suspiciously excited wag. His toys are buried all over the yard - but one spot seems a little too special. Follow the muddy paw prints, look past what's obvious, and see what festive secret this good boy has tucked away beneath the surface.

**Hint 1**: Maybe….your missing something.

**Hint 2**: Don’t trust what your image viewer shows, perhaps it doesn't show everything.
