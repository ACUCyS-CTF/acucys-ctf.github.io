**Challenge Description**:

Dr. Elena Strand, a brilliant geneticist working on classified biocomputing research, vanished three weeks ago just as the Christmas season rolled in. Her laboratory was found abandoned, quiet like a beach after sunset, with most of her research wiped clean. However, forensic investigators managed to recover three files from her encrypted laptop backup drive.

Intelligence reports suggest Dr. Strand was extremely paranoid about data security and had been experimenting with "biological encryption" - using principles from molecular biology to encode sensitive information. She was known to say, while everyone else was packing for the holidays: "Nature solved the data storage problem billions of years ago. Why reinvent the wheel?"

With Christmas lights still flickering and the waves rolling in, your mission is to decode her backup files and discover what she was hiding before she disappeared.
