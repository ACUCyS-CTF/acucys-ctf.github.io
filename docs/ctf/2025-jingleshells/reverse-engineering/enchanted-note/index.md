**Challenge Description**: While strolling along a sun-soaked Christmas beach, you spot a festive scrap of parchment wedged beneath a palm tree wrapped in tinsel. At first glance, the message looks harmless - but something feels off. A simple holiday charm has scrambled the letters, hiding a secret beneath the surface. Break the spell, decode the message, and uncover the hidden flag before the tide rolls in.

**Hint**: A helpful elf grins and says: "Give the letters a little holiday spin - sometimes the secret is only a rotation away."
