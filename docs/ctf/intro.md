# ACUCyS CTF

The Australian Council of University Cyber Societies (ACUCyS) coordinates and supports Capture The Flag (CTF) activity across our member university cyber clubs. This space collects write-ups, challenge walkthroughs, and shared learning from events run by ACUCyS and its member societies.

CTFs are a practical way for students to build skills in areas like web security, cryptography, reverse engineering, forensics, OSINT, and more. Challenges here are selected to reflect real‑world problem solving while still being approachable for students at different stages of their cyber security journey.

Use this section to:
- Explore past challenges and official or community write-ups.
- Learn how different teams approached the same problem.
- Discover techniques and tools you can apply in future ACUCyS and club CTFs.

If you are part of a member society and would like to contribute additional write-ups, please contact your ACUCyS representative or reach out via the main site at [acucys.org](https://www.acucys.org/).
