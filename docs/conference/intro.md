# ACUCyS Conference

The ACUCyS Conference concept is focused on creating a national, student‑led cyber security forum that amplifies student voices, showcases club initiatives, and connects students with educators and industry partners. It is designed to sit alongside ACUCyS CTFs and hackathons as a more discussion‑ and presentation‑driven space.

A future ACUCyS Conference would bring together:

- Student speakers sharing technical talks, project demos, and community initiatives.
- Panels and conversations with academics and industry practitioners.
- Sessions that explore pathways into cyber security and adjacent disciplines.
- Spaces for club leaders to compare notes on governance, events, and community building.

This documentation area will eventually host programmes, talk abstracts, slides, and recordings from ACUCyS conference activity, as well as guidance for university clubs that want to contribute content or help shape future events.
