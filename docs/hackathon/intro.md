# ACUCyS Hackathon

The ACUCyS Hackathon brings together student teams from university cyber security societies across Australia to work on practical, problem‑driven projects. Rather than a pure CTF, the hackathon format focuses on building and showcasing solutions – from defensive tooling and automation through to learning resources and community‑focused initiatives.

The aim is to give students structured, time‑boxed experience working in small, multidisciplinary teams on challenges that look and feel closer to real‑world briefs. It complements ACUCyS CTF activity by emphasising design, collaboration, documentation, and delivery alongside technical depth.

In this section you will eventually find:

- High‑level overviews of each ACUCyS hackathon.
- Problem statements and challenge briefs.
- Summaries of standout solutions and key learning outcomes.
- Reflections and guidance for clubs running their own hackathons.

As future events are held, this space will grow into a reference library for student‑led cyber hackathons within the ACUCyS network.
